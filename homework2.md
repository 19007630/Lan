**Lab 02**

sorry,when i make this experiment,i forget to take pictures,
but the next time i will remember.
The sensor that our group is assigned to is temperture

**Temperture Sensor**
When the Temperature sensor is connected, connect the left pin 
to 5v and the right pin to GND.
Turn on the serial monitor reading and the temperature rises as
the finger holds down the sensor. 
Place the book on the sensor and the temperature drops. Put a cup 
of cool water on the sensor and the temperature drop.


**Light Sensor**
The photosensor is, through experiments, I found that the sensor 
can feel the intensity of the ambient light and return the 
corresponding analog value, 0-1023. Normal indoor natural light, 
the analog value is about 20-30. The brighter the light, the larger 
its value. When I hold the sensor by hand, the sensor does not feel 
the light, and its value decreases.
